# An interesting take on COVID-19 Data

A friend, [Wendy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendyxtzhang/) and I worked on a mini project to visualize [COVID-19 data](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases).

So far, it's in a script. We're not sure if we want to tunr it into a website or app yet. 

How to use the script:
1. `pip install folium` (You can read more about [folium](https://pypi.org/project/folium/))
2. run the script line by line.
  - when you get to the third block, pick which country you want to see.
  - After "admiring" the amazing map we made from [a folium example](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium/issues/1010)), please feel free to pick a province/state that you would like to see. 
  - After picking that, you got more picking to do! Now, you're picking the date you want to see.
3. If the code hasn't broken so far, you should see an animation that looks kinda like [this](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/python-visualization/folium/blob/master/examples/Plugins.ipynb#Timestamped-GeoJSON).

This mini project is inspired by [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)), a R packgae, and it's something productive for us to do during quarantine.
